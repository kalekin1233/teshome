        <h1>History</h1>
    
    <p>
        In the history of technology, emerging technologies are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of technology.
       Over centuries innovative methods and new technologies are developed and opened up. Some of these technologies are due to theoretical
       research, and others from commercial research and development. Technological growth includes incremental developments and disruptive 
       technologies. An example of the former was the gradual roll-out of DVD (digital video disc) as a development intended to follow on from
       the previous optical technology compact disc. By contrast, disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous 
       technology and makes it redundant, for example, the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by automobiles and other vehicles.
        5G has actually been years in the making.<br />

        During an interview with Tech Republic, Kevin Ashton described how he coined the term "the Internet of Things" – or IoT for short – during
        a PowerPoint presentation he gave in the 1990s to convince Procter & Gamble to start using RFID tag technology. The phrase caught on and IoT
        was soon touted as the next big digital revolution that would see billions of connected devices seamlessly share data across the globe.
        According to Ashton, a mobile phone isn’t a phone, it’s the IoT in your pocket; a number of network-connected sensors that help you accomplish
        everything from navigation to photography to communication and more. The IoT will see data move out of server centers and into what are known
        as ‘edge devices’ such as Wi-Fi-enabled appliances like fridges, washing machines, and cars. By the early 2000s, developers knew that 3G and
        even 4G networks wouldn’t be able to support such a network. As 4G’s latency of between 40ms and 60ms is too slow for real-time responses,
        a number of researchers started developing the next generation of mobile networks. In 2008, NASA helped launch the Machine-to-Machine Intelligence (M2Mi)
        Corp to develop IoT and M2M technology, as well as the 5G technology needed to support it. In the same year, South Korea developed a 5G R&D program,
        while New York University founded the 5G-focused NYU WIRELESS in 2012. The superior connectivity offered by 5G promised to transform everything from
        banking to healthcare. 5G offers the possibility of innovations such as remote surgeries, telemedicine and even remote vital sign monitoring that could
        save lives. Three South Korean carriers – KT, LG Uplus and SK Telecom – rolled out live commercial 5G services last December and promise a simultaneous
        March 2019 launch of 5G across the country.<br />

     <p> Verizon led the way in developing and deploying 5G and accelerating 5G innovation. In 2015, we created the 5G Technology Forum (5GTF)—bringing together
        key partners like Ericsson, Qualcomm, Intel and Samsung—to move the entire 5G ecosystem forward. We used this 5G TF standard to launch our 5G Home service
        in the US in LA, Sacramento, Houston and Indianapolis last year. This standard set the foundation for the global standard. The 5GTF work helped accelerate 
        the release of the 3GPP 5G New Radio (NR) standard in December of 2017. On April 3, 2019, of we introduced 5G mobile service in parts of Chicago and Minneapolis.
        Customers in those cities were the first in the world to have a 5G-enabled smartphone connected to a 5G network. Since then, Verizon has been able to introduce a
        number of 5G phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G, Galaxy Note 10+ 5G, LG V50 ThinQ™ 5G among others.<br />
