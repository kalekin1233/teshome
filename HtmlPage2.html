      <br> 5G is the 5th generation mobile network. It is a new global wireless standard after 1G, 2G, 3G,
         and 4G networks. 5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to connect virtually everyone
         and everything together including machines, objects, and devices.</p>

       <p><br> 5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds, ultra low latency,
         more reliability, massive network capacity, increased availability, and a more uniform user experience
         to more users. Higher performance and improved efficiency empower new user experiences and connects new industries.</p>

      <p><br> The exponential growth of wireless data services driven by mobile Internet and smart devices has
       triggered the investigation of the 5G cellular network. Around 2020, the new 5G mobile networks
       are expected to be deployed. 5G networks will have to support multimedia applications with a
       wide variety of requirements, including higher peak and user data rates, reduced latency,
       enhanced indoor coverage, improved energy efficiency and so on.

        5G is the fifth generation technology standard for broadband cellular networks, which cellular phone companies
     began deploying worldwide in 2019, and is the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to
     most current cellphones.[2] 5G networks are predicted to have more than 1.7 billion subscribers worldwide by 2025,
     according to the GSM Association.[3] Like its predecessors, 5G networks are cellular networks, in which the service
     area is divided into small geographical areas called cells. All 5G wireless devices in a cell are connected to the
     Internet and telephone network by radio waves through a local antenna in the cell. The main advantage of the new 
     networks is that they will have greater bandwidth, giving higher download speeds,[2] eventually up to 10 gigabits per
     second (Gbit/s).[4] Due to the increased bandwidth, it is expected the networks will not exclusively serve cellphones
     like existing cellular networks, but also be used as general internet service providers for laptops and desktop computers,
     competing with existing ISPs such as cable internet, and also will make possible new applications in internet of things (IoT)
     and machine to machine areas. 4G cellphones are not able to use the new networks, which require 5G enabled wireless devices.
