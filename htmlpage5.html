        <h1>Applications</h1>
        <p>
            As 5G rolls out, what new IoT applications will we see? What 5G use cases will be enabled by the higher bandwidth and 
            faster throughput? Will life change as we know it? Yes, life will change with 5G and the anticipated applications it 
            will enable, but not ubiquitously. There will be a growing divide of network connectivity and services between urban 
            and rural areas because it is impractical to deploy 5G everywhere right away. The fundamental idea behind 5G is a 
            single network that is flexible enough to handle a variety of different use cases. In order to deliver the promise of 5G,
            mobile network operators (MNOs) have to build a dense network with a massive amount of network nodes that will form the 5G 
            infrastructure.
            <h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
            Autonomous vehicles are one of the most anticipated 5G applications. Vehicle technology is advancing rapidly to support 
            the autonomous vehicle future. Onboard computer systems are evolving with levels of compute power previously only seen in 
            data centers. We hear about autonomous vehicles today, and many people wonder what the barriers are to making this future 
            technology a reality. Many different developments in vehicle technology, network speed, data throughput and machine learning 
            must come together for the fully autonomous vehicle future to materialize. 5G networks will be an enormous enabler for autonomous 
            vehicles, due to the dramatically reduced latency, as vehicles will be able to respond 10-100 times faster than over current 
            cellular networks. The ultimate goal is a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication network. This will enable vehicles to 
            automatically respond to objects and changes around them almost instantaneously. A vehicle must be able to send and receive 
            messages in milliseconds in order to brake or shift directions in response to road signs, hazards and people crossing the street.
            <h2>5G IoT in Smart City Infrastructure and Traffic Management</h2>
            Many cities around the world today are deploying intelligent transportation systems (ITS), and are planning to support connected 
            vehicle technology. Aspects of these systems are relatively easy to install using current communications systems that support smart 
            traffic management to handle vehicle congestion and route emergency vehicles. Connected vehicle technology will enable bidirectional 
            communications from vehicle to vehicle (V2V), and vehicle to infrastructure, (V2X) to promote safety across transportation systems. 
            Smart cities are now installing sensors in every intersection to detect movement and cause connected and autonomous vehicles to react as needed.
            The communications backbone to support connected vehicle technology can be phased in today, well before 5G is fully deployed, dramatically 
            improving pedestrian and vehicle safety.
            <h>5G IoT Applications in Industrial Automation</h>
            The key benefits of 5G in the industrial automation space are wireless flexibility, reduced costs and the viability of applications that 
            are not possible with current wireless technology. Industrial automation is in use today, and most likely you have seen videos showing synchronized 
            robotics at work in factories and supply chain applications. Today these applications require cables, as Wi-Fi does not provide the range, mobility 
            and quality of service required for industrial control, and the latency of today’s cellular technology is too high. With 5G, industrial automation 
            applications can cut the cord and go fully wireless, enabling more efficient smart factories.
            <h2>Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)</h2>
            The low latency of 5G will make AR and VR applications both immersive and far more interactive. In industrial applications, for example, a technician 
            wearing 5G AR goggles could see an overlay of a machine that would identify parts, provide repair instructions, or show parts that are not safe to touch. 
            The opportunities for highly responsive industrial applications that support complex tasks will be extensive. In business environments, you can have AR 
            meetings where it appears two people are sitting together in the same room, turning boring phone or 2D video conferences into more interactive 3D gatherings.
            Sporting events and experiences will likely be some of the top applications for 5G in the consumer space. Anytime you need to react quickly to a stimulus, 
            such as in a sports training application, it must happen with minimal latency. For example, if two people wearing 4G LTE goggles were trying to kick a a soccer 
            ball back and forth, it would be very difficult to correctly time their response, because by the time their brain has received the input that the ball has come 
            to them, it’s too late. But with 5G goggles, the lower latency enables the receiver to see the ball and kick it back before it passes.
            <h2>5G IoT Applications for Drones</h2>
            Drones have a vast and growing set of use cases today beyond the consumer use for filming and photography. For example, utilities are using drones today for 
            equipment inspection. Logistics and retail companies are looking at drone delivery of goods. The trend will continue, and together with 5G we will be able to push 
            limits of drones that exist today, especially in range and interactivity.
            <h2>High Speed Use Cases for 5G</h2>
            In the high speed uses cases, we will see a range of applications that currently are hampered by slow speeds. Fixed wireless access (FWA) will provide ultra-fast 
            Internet for consumers and businesses. Higher bandwidth applications like 4K and in the future 8K streaming, or 360 degree video will enable high-quality, immersive 
            experiences at real-time speeds for consumers. As the viewer you will be able to control the angle you want to take. For example in a video car race, you can look 
            around and see who is next to or behind you. Businesses will be able to store more information in the cloud and access it over fast, low-latency 5G as if it were 
            stored locally. This reduces the need for expensive on-premise servers. And instead of needing a fast laptop for rendering information locally, you render in the 
            cloud and have it streamed to you. It will be just like local but you can use your phone for these high-end apps.
